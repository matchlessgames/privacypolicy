1.  ADVERTISING
Matchless partners with third parties to display advertising throughout the Services or to manage its advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests if you are older than 13, and contextual advertising if you are younger than 13. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising please contact. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

2.SECURITY
The security of your Personal Information is important to Matchless. Matchless follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to Matchless, both during transmission and once it is received. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, Matchless cannot guarantee its absolute security. While no security system is completely secure, Matchless and its third-party partners and vendors take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by Matchless. For Matchless, this includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that all Personal and Financial Information is disclosed only on a "need to know" basis and ensuring that all Personal Information collected by Matchless is done so via secured connections and protected and encrypted (using secure socket layer technology,"SSL") by industrial grade security software to guard against unauthorized access.
3. HOW INFORMATION IS USED, SHARED AND DISCLOSED
Matchless does not sell, and generally does not disclose, your Personal Information to third-parties without your consent. Except as set forth in Section 10 of this Privacy Policy, parents have the right to consent to collection and use of personal information from their child without also consenting to its disclosure to third-parties, as Matchless does not share information that may be collected from your child. Matchless uses Personal, Non-Personal and Financial Information, among other things, to monitor system performance, analyze internal business systems, improve the Matchless Services, fulfill requests for additional products and services, contact you about promotional and marketing activities, provide customer support, and conduct research. The use and protection of information is an important component of Matchless's business. Examples of how Matchless shares and discloses your information is as follows:
Legal. Matchless may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities, and other legal process, and to establish/exercise Matchless's legal rights. Matchless may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when Matchless believes that disclosure is necessary to protect Matchless's rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. Matchless may share Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Matchless's	Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
Business Transfers. As Matchless continues to develop its business, Matchless may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries, or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third-parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of Matchless's assets are acquired or Matchless merges with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that Matchless reserves the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, Matchless will use reasonable efforts to notify you before Personal Information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control. Matchless may use third-party companies and individuals to perform functions on Matchless's behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, processing payments, hosting, data storage, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. Matchless will provide such entities with access to certain information needed to perform their functions, but will take measures to ensure that they may not use it for other purposes. Matchless shares information only as described above and with third-parties that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or to a privacy policy that is at least as protective as this Privacy Policy.
